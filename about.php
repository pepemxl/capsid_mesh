			Viruses are the most abundant pathogens affecting all forms of life. 
			One of the major components of a virus is the protein shell encapsulating the genomic material (capsid). 
			Descriptions of this macromolecular complex have been proposed at different scales of approximation. 
			Still, little is known about the structural properties of the viral capsid. 
			We present CapsidMesh, a software that generates robust volumetric meshes for icosahedral capsids based on atomic information [found <a href="http://viperdb.scripps.edu/">here</a>], suitable for Finite Element Analysis and the study of macromolecular properties.
